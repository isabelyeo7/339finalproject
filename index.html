            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                For my SI 339 final project, I've decided to incorporate my keen interest in fashion and 
                style into the web development skills gained from this class. I've decided to showcase the 
                different style aesthetics that I take inspiration from. Shown below are outfits that I heavily consider to 
                exhibit my personal style, as well as a few designers that I really look up to.

            <p>
                Shown below are some outfits that convey my personal style and what I want it to grow into. 
                These are taken from my pinterest board, and are outfits that I try to emulate when I put together
                outfits of my own.

            <p>
                Here are two designers/brands that I take heavy inspiration from and deeply admire. I've alwasy been fascinated and enraptured
                by their work. I love the aesthetics that these desginers and brands embody, and hope to one day populate my closet with a
                multitude of pieces by them.

                <h3>Jean Paul Gautier</h3>
                <p>A worldwide renowned French fashion designer, Jean Paul Gautier is known for pushing the boundaries of 
                    fashion and challenging conventions. His work is marked by unconventional silhouettes, reimagining classic garments with 
                    unexpected twists and blurring gender boundaries thorugh hyper-androgny. He incoporates unexpected materials, such as 
                    newspaper and plastic bags (seen in his 2010 couture collection). He also utilizes contrasing elements, blending high and 
                    low fashion, luxury and streetwear, and traditional and contemporary influences.

                <h3>Vivienne Westwood</h3>
                <p>A famous English fashion designer, Vivienne Westwood embodies a bold, fearless, and rebellious style throughout her work. 
                    She takes heavy inspiration from historical fashion, parodying English looks, creating innovative takes on traditional 
                    tailoring, and making sexually charged revivals of past looks. She also has a heavy punk influence in her designs, with 
                    unconventional silhouettes, distressed fabrics, and motifs like safety pins, tartan prints, and bondage inspired details. 
                    She is known for her corsets and use of tartan, and remains an alternative and creative force in fashion.
